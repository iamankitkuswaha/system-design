# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation in Java. It follows an object-oriented design with key components like the Board, Game, and Cell classes, along with an enum for Symbol (X and O).

## Project Structure:
- **Board:** Represents the game board, initialized with a given size.
- **Game:** Manages the gameplay, takes a board and player symbols as input, and handles user interaction.
- **Cell:** Represents a position on the board with x and y coordinates.
- **Symbol:** Enum defining the possible player symbols (X and O).

- ✅ **Clean & Modular:** Each class has a single responsibility, making the code easy to maintain.
- ✅ **Scalable:** Can be extended for larger board sizes or additional features.
- ✅ **Object-Oriented:** Uses encapsulation and abstraction effectively.
